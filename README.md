## Description
        
In this project I created a weather dashboard that will show the current weather of a given city and the 5 day forecast for that city as well. It utilizes APIs to gather the data and localStorage to store the previously searched city so it can be searched upon clicking on it. 

## Installation 

Open it in your browser 

## Usage

Type the city which weather you're interested in and press search.
